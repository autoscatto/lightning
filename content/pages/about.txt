About the author
================

I'm most passionate about creating enjoyable user interfaces, especially
at the cusp of hardware and software.

I'm currently a Developer Programs Engineer on the Chrome team, doing my
part to bring more awesomeness to the modern web platform.

Before Google, I was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University,
where I mostly did HCI research in physical, wearable and social
computing.

I became interested in HCI after working as an engineer at Apple for a
couple of years. Dipping into Apple's culture, I learned to appreciate
the importance of high quality user interfaces. At Apple I wrote large
chunks of iWork.com and interned on iWeb.

I joined Apple right after graduating from the University of British
Columbia in Vancouver, Canada with a Bachelors degree. I studied
mathematics and computer science, focusing on algorithms and computer
graphics.
