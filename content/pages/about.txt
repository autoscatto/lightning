About the author
================

I'm most passionate about creating useful, enjoyable user interfaces,
especially at the cusp of hardware and software. In my projects, I tend
to gravitate to web technologies because of the flexibility of the
platform.

I'm currently an engineer on the Chrome developer relations team, doing
my part to bring more awesomeness to the modern web platform.

Before Google, I was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University,
where I mostly did HCI research in physical, wearable and social
computing.

I became interested in HCI after working as an engineer at Apple for a
couple of years. Dipping into Apple's culture, I learned to appreciate
the importance of high quality user interfaces. At Apple I wrote large
chunks of iWork.com and interned on iWeb.

I joined Apple right after graduating from the University of British
Columbia in Vancouver, Canada with a Bachelors in Science. I studied
mathematics and computer science, focusing on algorithms and computer
graphics.

I grew up in Vancouver, Canada and spent my formative childhood years in
St. Petersburg, Russia.
