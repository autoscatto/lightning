About this site
===============

This site is statically generated with [Lightning][lightning], a
blogging engine I wrote. The basic idea is that I write all of my
content like this:

    About this site
    ===============

    This site is statically generated with [Lightning][lightning]

Then a script converts it into the HTML/CSS that you are reading now.

There are many such projects, (eg. [Hyde][hyde],
[Octopress][octopress]). I wrote Lightning to scratch some specific
itches (which may or may not have been addressed in other projects by
the time you read this):

- Incremental builds (only rebuild what changed).
- Logical placement of content-specific assets (in same dir as
  content).
- Minimalist metadata header.
- Output that doesn't require htaccess, rewrite rules and other HTTPD
  specific setup.

I designed this site with aiming for appealing typography for optimal
readability. Since my visitors are increasingly coming from a variety of
devices, I also created three variants of the site for small, medium and
large screens via media queries:

    @media screen and (max-width: $small) {/* small */}
    @media screen and (min-width: $small) and (max-width: $large) {/* medium */}
    @media screen and (min-width: $large) {/* large */}

The layout of this site is largely based on inspiration from designers
far more skilled than I, including:
