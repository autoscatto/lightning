Before Google, I was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University,
where I did HCI research in wearable and social computing. I also
studied user experience research and design and led an interdisciplinary
team working on a project for Portugal Telecom Innovation.

I became interested in HCI after working as an engineer at Apple for a
couple of years. Dipping into Apple's culture, I learned to appreciate
the importance of high quality user interfaces. At Apple I wrote large
chunks of iWork.com and interned on iWeb.

I joined Apple right after graduating from the University of British
Columbia in Vancouver, Canada with a Bachelors degree. I studied
mathematics and computer science, focusing on algorithms and computer
graphics.
