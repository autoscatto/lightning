snip: A recap of my favorite sessions at my first web conference.



Yesterday I got back from the Web 2.0 Expo in New York. There were many
interesting sessions, and I, for the most part, took notes! Here is a
short list of my five favorite speakers, in no particular order:

1.  Cal Henderson's whirlwind [introduction to video on the web][]. Cal
    really likes speak really fast, to make typos in his slides and to
    cuss, all of which makes for a very informative and entertaining
    hour.
2.  John Resig's [talk about Processing.js][], his port of
    [Processing][] to canvas. I'm constantly dealing with graphics on
    the web, and it's awesome to have such a powerful library available.
    Pretty demos, too!
3.  Jason Fried's short but sweet keynote talk, focusing on minimalism
    in product management, and proper (read: very narrow) scoping of
    features. The philosophical question of "what would your software be
    like if it was physical?" struck me as a very useful thing to think
    about.
4.  A [browser panel][] including Chris Wilson from MS, Brendan Eich
    from Mozilla and an unnamed developer from Chrome responded to a
    nice set of questions about future directions of browsers. Poor
    Chris got a beating IE7's flaws, lack of canvas/SVG support,
    barriers to plugin development for IE.
5.  Geir Magnusson Jr delivered an excellent introduction to [scaling data in the cloud][].

I also had the chance to talk to and bounce some ideas off of Pete
Koomen, a Google App Engine product manager. He told me that there are
plans both for process scheduling, and for support of django-1.0 down
the road, but of course gave no time frame for either. Overall, the
conference was interesting - there were other good sessions and keynotes
which I simply haven't bothered to write up. The crowd wasn't very
technical though, comprising in large part designers, marketers and
managers.
