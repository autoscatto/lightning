  fantastic samba rock.




Last month I took a work trip to SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I gave four Chrome/HTML5
presentations and talked to many engineers and designers over the course of the
week, trying hard not to sound like a broken record. Luckily Brazil has a lot
of people so the audiences were different each time! Here's a link to my
[slides][], that I tweaked slightly depending on the audience.

I'll be dumping all of my slide decks and/or talk videos to [smustalks][] on
AppEngine. I've made the switch from building slides in Keynote to using this
fantastic HTML5 [slide deck][] template and my favorite [text editor][].

## Food

* Delicious fruits of all varieties: exotic cashew, persimmon, star fruit, guyava, and way tastier bananas.
* Ridiculously massive portions of sashimi at japanese restaurants.
* The Rodizio we went to was super exquisite. Largest salad bar ever, including caviar (srsly).

## Life

* SP is a concrete jungle like nothing I've ever seen. The whole city is built up within a 60km radius.
* Chaotic traffic patterns and insane motorcyclists abound. Everyone loves to drive between lanes and honk gratuitously.
* Super bumpy roads date back to the dictatorship days. If you take the wrong exit, prepare to jump around.
* Helicopters fly all over town and sometimes land precariously close to unsuspecting window cleaners dangling from highrise roofs.
* Beware foul smelling rivers and slums on the way to Friday morning meetings!

## Work

* Super friendly people but my Portuguese skills failed to topple the language barrier.
* Long process to get into any office building. Some ask for ID, others ask for passport. Takes half an hour just to get in...
* Somehow, Google Brazil still feels like Google!

After my work was done, I took some [travel photos][] and heard
[Samba da Minha Terra][] live, and by so doing, joined the ranks of Don and
Magdalena!

    I've never sailed the Amazon,
    I've never reached Brazil;
    But the Don and Magdalena,
    They can go there when they will!

                - R. Kipling
