PhoneGap Games in the Android Market

snip: On how I took Onslaught, wrapped it in PhoneGap published, it to the Android
  Market and got angry emails.



A little while ago I took an existing game called [Onslaught!][] by
[Lost Decade Games][] and hacked it to use onscreen controls instead of
the keyboard so that it could be enjoyed on mobile phones. This was
intended as a proof of concept and not a polished product as I
encountered many technical show-stoppers, described in the 
[previous blog post][]. I've been itching to experiment with [PhoneGap][] apps
in the Android Market, so despite obvious issues, I decided to pack up my
Onslaught! fork and upload it to the market. 

I expected there to be many gameplay issues with varying screen sizes
and form factors. I strongly suspected my use of the target-densityDpi
would break on non-Nexus One handsets. Indeed, my suspicions were
confirmed when, after a nominal $25 fee and a short setup, I uploaded
the PhoneGap-created .apk to the Market.

## Results

I've never published any application to any application store before. I
was surprised to see Onslaught! available in the market within seconds
of my submission, with a surge of new users and comments piling in
nearly immediately. Apparently the experience is particularly horrible
on the Galaxy S and it doesn't work at all on HTC Hero. The day I
unleashed Onslaught! unto the Market, I was contacted by someone from
[Zeemote][], who politely suggested that the game "could possibly
benefit from the use of a joystick for improved control", and promptly
**sent me a Zeemote** to experiment with. I haven't found the time yet,
but thanks Zeemote, that was pretty sweet of you â€“ nobody's ever sent me
free stuff before!

Obviously this is a pretty embarrassing state of affairs, and I, like
any slightly self respecting developer decided to remove the app from
the market to hide the evidence! I also received a very friendly
**cease-and-desist** style letter from the good folks at LDG (this is
one of those times when the "ask for forgiveness, not permission"
approach has its drawbacks). Needless to say, I gladly pulled the game
and apologized profusely to the developers. For posterity, the 
[APK is still available][].

## PhoneGap

Creating an Android PhoneGap application out of a web application is
pretty simple. It's a matter of following a few steps outline on 
[this documentation page][]. The process varies slightly for each platform and
would surely become painful and tedious for developers supporting
multiple platforms. Luckily the PhoneGap folks will soon have just the
thing to address this issue. [PhoneGap Build][] is a service that
promises to package and compile web apps for a variety of platforms.
Looking forward to trying it out!
