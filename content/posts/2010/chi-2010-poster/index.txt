CHI 2010 Poster
===============

I'm confirmed to go to [CHI2010][] in Atlanta, so I spent some time
making a poster for the [Ubiquitous Drums][] project that was
miraculously accepted as a [WIP][]. It's nice to pretend to be a visual
designer sometimes. Thanks to Mark, Jenn and Rebeca for your input.

I would really appreciate additional suggestions on how to improve the
[poster][], or your thoughts on academic posters in general. Why are
they usually so ugly?
