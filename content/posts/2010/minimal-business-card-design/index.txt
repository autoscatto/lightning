snip: My quest to create the most minimalist business cards possible!



Business card design is a tricky art. It's a fairly constrained space,
but that's what design is all about, right? I'm ordering a personal set
of [moo mini cards][]. These are small, two sided prints. One side
contains an image, and the other contains contact information. On the
image side, I'm putting snippets of travel photography. The other side
is by default a conventional list of contact information, but moo
conveniently allows it to be replaced by a custom image. 

Rather than having each field separately labeled, I tried to uncover as
much information as possible within my email address. Hidden inside are
my first name, last name, website, and twitter account! Here's a minimal
design concept that tries to break it down.

In my case, my email address contains all relevant info except the phone
number which I don't want to include anyway. I hope that this simple
idea can inspire you to come up with something more polished. Looking
forward to what you come up with! P.S. Thanks for the help, [Jenn][]!
