snip: A joke-hack involving a CD, duct tape, an iPhone dock and your car.



Shortly after buying my first iPhone over a year ago, I found the right,
low-budget solution to my in-car music needs. The ingredients involved
are the following commonly found household items:

- One Compact Disk
- Some Duct Tape

The idea is to take the iPhone dock and stick it onto the CD with duct
tape. Next, jam the CD into a tight slot in the dash of your car (easy
to find for a Del Sol owner). Finally, attach power cables and/or AUX
audio jacks to the dock. The result is a flexible, shock-absorbent mount
for your everyone's favorite phone. I've used this hack for well over a
year now with no problems. Here's how it looks in the interior of my
car:

In a word: awesome.
