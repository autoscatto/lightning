snip: A much needed blog redesign.



Since starting this site, I've been using a lightly tweaked version of the
[ClockWorkAir][] theme. The old design featured a prominent quote in prime
screen real estate and a tag cloud in the upper sidebar. A blue title bar,
reminiscent of the default wordpress theme, graced the blog header. The main
text was small and there was hardly enough room to place images in the left
margin. Here was my old blog design:

As I had hoped, the design class I'm taking at CMU gave me some good ideas.
Here's my new blog design. I'm much happier with it than with the former look,
but still have a backlog of things to tweak. My design was inspired by several
[people's][] [web logs][], which bring together form and function in a way
which appeals to me. Please give me constructive feedback on the new design if
you have time. I will release the wordpress theme if anyone wants it â€” I just
haven't had time to bundle it yet. Here is my new blog design:

As of this month it's been a year since my first blog post. Surprisingly, I've
been writing one to two blog entries per month and hope to keep my musings
flowing at approximately the same rate in the future. It's very rewarding as a
writer to have a steady flow of visitors, some recurring readership, and even
the odd discussion here or there. Thank you all.
