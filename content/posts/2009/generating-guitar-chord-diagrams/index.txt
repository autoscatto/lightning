Generating Guitar Chord Diagrams

snip: A python script that generates all possible ways of playing the specified guitar
  chord. I used this for Guitar Unleashed.



One day I wanted to add a feature to [Guitar Unleashed][] which exists
in some of the better guitar tab sites. When a user hovers over a chord,
they are shown a diagram representing the guitar fret with overlaid
finger positions required to produce this chord. Many of the most
popular sites do this by showing a crude, plain-text representation of
the chord.

For example, a C chord is shown as follows:

    e ---|---|---|---|---|
    B -x-|---|---|---|---|
    G ---|---|---|---|---|
    D ---|-x-|---|---|---|
    A ---|---|-x-|---|---|
    E ---|---|-o-|---|---|

Typeset guitar chord representation looks very different. Two most
popular variants of the C chord would appear above the staff with small
symbols that look something like this: 

![C][]
![C_1][] 

Such images have many benefits as compared to the plain text version:

-   Convention: many guitar players are used to learning from sheet
    music, so this chord notation is familiar to them.
-   Readability: the image representation is more compact and more
    pleasant to read.
-   Completeness: the image version has an easy way to display barre
    chords and specify fingerings (not pictured)

True to Guitar Unleashed's mission of being a truly usable guitar chords
site, I decided to display typeset fret diagrams. For the
implementation, a program would pre-generate images on the server based
on the encoded chord shape and then serve these images dynamically via
JavaScript. Unfortunately, I found no software to generate such images
for all popular chords, so I ended up developing my own. 

From some brief
research, I decided that [lilypond fret diagrams][] are the most elegant
way of creating such images. The alternative was to use [GCHORDS][]
whose output I liked less, and which required depending on TeX.
Typically lilypond typesets an entire piece of sheet music on a staff,
with clefs, key signatures, etc. After discovering a really great
[lilypond bundle for textmate][], I managed to get rid of these
unnecessary features and display just a fret diagram. The following
python-parametrized lilypond template does the trick:

    \include "lilypond-book-preamble.ly"
    \version "2.10.0"
    \markup
    \fret-diagram-terse #"%(chord_markup)s"

Then, using lilypond's fret diagram encoding, a python script replaces
`%(chord_markup)s` with the desired markup. Lilypond's markup is very
terse but mostly manageable. Sample markup for a C chord looks like
this: `x;3;2;o;1;o;`, while the barre version looks a little bit more
bizarre, like this: `3-(;3;5;5;5;3-);`. 

My python program contains a list of chord shapes for the most popular chords,
encoded in the manner above, then outputs images for each chord and variant
into a directory.  I've made it [available for download][], in case your next
project needs generated fret diagrams with a highly customizable look. You can
also see the diagrams live at [guitarunleashed.com][Guitar Unleashed].
