After spending a fair bit of time [monitoring twitter feeds][], I was
pleasantly surprised by the [world][]'s [response][] to the recently
announced [iwork.com][]. There were some [premature][] [flames][], but
mostly as a result of a fundamental misunderstanding of iwork.com's
purpose. Someone even gave a [technical breakdown][] of the application,
which is especially endearing to me as an insider.
