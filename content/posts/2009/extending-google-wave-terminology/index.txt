Extending Google Wave Terminology
=================================

snip: A chronicle of some emergent lingo from the Google Wave service.



For the last few days, I've had the chance to get my feet wet in the
[developer sandbox][] of Google Wave. My first impressions are very
positive. I am as awed now by the scope and potential impact of Wave as
I was after watching the hour long [video from Google I/O][]. 

As consolation to those itching to *try it already*, bear in mind that the
sandbox is in a very raw state right now. Performance issues aside, informative
text such as:

> This wave is experiencing some slight turbulence, and may explode. If
> you don't wanna explode, please re-open the wave. Some recent changes
> may not be saved.

and

> "Everything's shiny, Cap'n. Not to fret!" Unfortunately, you'll need
> to *refresh*. Wanna tell Dr. Wave what happened?

appear quite often. Of course, this is totally expected for pre-alpha
software -- I'm merely pointing out the humorous messages!

For a more intimate look into Wave, especially some of the deeper, more social
issues, here is part of an ongoing ha-ha-only-serious joke from the internal
wave-discuss group about extending existing [Wave terminology][]. The list is
really telling, since indeed, I have read many ridiculous Drips and most of my
fresh waves Surge only to get Borked by rickrolley.

- **Wavejack** -- To hijack the contents of a wave to where it no longer resembles the original idea
- ** Drip** -- Stupid question no one answers
- ** Bork** -- To add useless, noisy or destructive bots to a wave. (aka The Swedish Chef or rickrolley or the borkforceone bot)
- ** Surge** -- The effect of a fresh wave that elicits the chaos of mass editing
- ** Drown** -- To have so many waves to follow that one can't keep up with them 
- **Sea Sick** -- A state of dizziness induced by an overly active wave 
- **Tuna/Noise/Herring** -- Wave speak for Spam
- **Fishnet** -- Spam filter

Despite instabilities and widespread antisocial behavior, the wave sandbox is
alive with a flurry of activity. People are busy creating annoying bots,
forming role playing communities and writing collaborative books. So Google has
a lot of issues to work out, not in the least how to stop us all from drowning
:) 

So far, I haven't had a chance to write any interesting wave extensions, but
it's in my things to do!
