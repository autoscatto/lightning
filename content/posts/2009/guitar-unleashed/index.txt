snip: A web application that lets users collaboratively edit guitar chords. It aims
  to globally improve the quality of guitar chords.



I've been collaborating with my dad on an experimental web-based guitar chord
editing service. It's still a work in progress, but we are ready to launch a
beta version. Please visit [http://www.guitarunleashed.com/][] to check it out
and provide feedback. 

We hope that the major features of the service are easily discoverable, but in
case they are not, here is a list:

-   Add chords to your lyrics by clicking on any character
-   Move chords via drag and drop
-   Search for songs created by other users or from external sources
-   Save your work and share it with others
-   Add songs that you like to your favorites list
-   Already have lyrics with chords? Create a new song, paste lyrics
    with chords in and see the chords come to life.

Please note that the application relies heavily on JavaScript, so it needs to
be enabled in your browser.

## Known issues

-   Some lyrics may display incorrectly. This is an issue with
    [LyricWiki.org][]
-   Long chords placed at the beginning or the end of lyrics line may
    extend outside of the editing area
-   Long lines in lyrics are not handled elegantly

## Future features

-   Editing lyric text
-   Commenting on songs
-   Searching sources of lyrics and chords other than LyricWiki
-   Song books
