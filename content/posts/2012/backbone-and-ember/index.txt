Backbone and Ember
==================

posted: 2012-02-15




[Ember][] and [Backbone][] are both promising JavaScript frameworks but have
completely different philosophies. In this post, I'll compare the two, both
from a practical and philosophical perspective. I'll defer to real world
experience with Backbone and [SproutCore][] (Ember's predecessor), as well as
basic experiments with Ember (full disclosure: haven't built a large Ember app
yet). I'll also supplement claims with quotes from a fantastic [conversation][]
from Freenode [#documentcloud][irc] on February 3rd, 2011. For quote
context, `wycats` is [Yehuda Katz][], one of the lead developers on Ember, and
`jashkenas` is [Jeremy Ashkenas][], one of the lead developers on Backbone.

Before I go into too much detail, it's pretty clear that both frameworks have
the same goal: to help developers build apps.

So we have a roughly apples-to-apples comparison. Let me dive in and talk about
some philosophical differences:

## Backbone at a glance

Backbone is a minimalist framework that builds on top of ideas from
jQuery to give some structure to web applications. It introduces
concepts of views, models, a restful sync interface, routers, etc, in
surprisingly little code. Backbone is the darling of microframework
lovers, who highly value small framework size and don't want to commit
to a single "full stack" solution.

Backbone is incredibly flexible, and doesn't impose how your views and
models should actually interact. The main benefit is that it adds some
structure to the app and provides convenient ways of listening to DOM
events and turning them into application events.

> 1:16 PM **wycats** "here's how you should think about your app structure"

Since Backbone is so small, it leaves a lot of decisions up to the
developer. This is both a blessing (flexibility, works for me, etc) and
a curse, since support for many things is missing.

## Ember at a glance

Ember has a very different history. It's an evolution of SproutCore,
which is a complete web application solution. Ember takes the core parts
of SproutCore - two-way data binding, computed properties, tight
template integration, and strips the rest off into sub-modules. Things
that come in module format are a data serialization layer (via [data][]),
routing (via [routes][]). Ember's out of the box functionality is
actually smaller than Backbone's, but it provides a higher level
abstraction.

I used SproutCore back in 2008 while working as an engineer on
iWork.com. It was a SproutCore pre-1.0 release, and things were a bit
rough. Ember seems to have come clean in many ways, presenting a more
consistent template data binding solution via Handlebars, and being a
lot less monolithic SproutCore once was.

Ember aims to provide a full solution in an opinionated way. Thus,
to get the most of the framework, developers must do things in a certain
style. While you're not forced to use Handlebars, it's the only way to
get some of the compelling features the framework provides (eg. for
two-way data binding). Many of the auxillary modules such as ember-data
are designed to fit will into the existing structure of the framework.

There is a sentiment from many people, including Backbone's founder that
much of what Ember provides is over-engineered:

## Different audiences

So to summarize at a high level, there are two camps (and excuse me
while I generalize a lot).

1. Lovers of micro-frameworks. JavaScript hackers seeking extra
   structure in their slightly complex apps. These people are
   comfortable mixing and matching frameworks, solving problems as they
   come, and just want to get started quickly.

2. Software Engineers that are used to a deep abstraction layer and a
   full service stack. These people are probably coming from native app
   development and want to write very complex applications on the web.

Basically, these two developers have different needs, come from
different programming cultures, and are maybe even writing different
applications.

## A more detailed comparison

After engineering with SproutCore, writing an app with Backbone, and
writing small amounts of Ember (mostly samples to get a feel for data
bindings, etc), I've got some sense of the issues that you will run into
when developing a moderately complex app. I'll go over some, and
supplement them with quotes from framework authors.

In general, Ember seeks to find common problems that developers face,
and solve them in an opinionated way. Backbone, on the other hand,
leaves it to developers solve their own problems in the way that works
for them.

### Templates

While Ember in theory lets you pick which templating engine to use, you
lose a lot of benefits if you're not using Handlebars.

> 1:29 PM **jashkenas** forcing your users to use logic-less templates is *incredibly* constraining.  
> 1:30 PM **tomdale** jashkenas: ember supports any templating language you'd like. you just don't get auto-updating  
> 1:30 PM **jashkenas** right, exactly.

In practice, my last project used Mustache because it was logic-less.
Such templating engines are my preference, and I'm happy to be
constrained to a pretty good templating system if that means access to
powerful features, cleaner application code and less boilerplate.

I don't think that Ember should be toting choice of template as a big
benefit. Like any application framework, Ember is a contract between
developer and framework author. You write in our style and we'll give
you powerful features. In an ideal world, this lets developers focus on
their app instead of dealing with middleware.

### Views

view decomposition is one of the first tasks a front end developer
faces. They need to decide which parts of their app will be implemented
with what view. Should each list item be its own view? Should the list
be a single monolithic view?

In my experience writing Backbone apps, views are very primitive and
tend to cause issues. There's no support for any sort of view nesting,
which is totally critical for large applications with complex UIs. In
contrast, Ember provides an easy way of nesting views inside one
another.

The other thing you'll notice with Backbone is that there's a lot of
micro-management required when building Backbone views. They need to
be properly cleaned up by hand, otherwise you end up with [zombie
views][so1] bound to events, or events that [don't fire at all][so2].

Some backbone projects, such as the [layout manager][], aim to remedy
some of these limitations by creating a Layout abstraction, that allows
nested views and handles a lot of the rendering. This is a very
interesting project, but I haven't tried it yet.

### MVC?

Ember is a traditional MVC framework, where it's clear which parts are
the view, the controller and the model. Backbone on the other hand, is
explicitly not an MVC. It never even claims to be!

In fact, if you read the [main page][Backbone], you'll notice that
there's no mention of controllers anywhere. Don't get me wrong: Backbone
still gives your applications structure, but has no opinion on the
gluing layer between data and presentation. I think Backbone once had
controllers, but they were renamed to routers, designed primarily for
handling URLs and history/pushState.

In my experience, there's very much a need for a controller when writing
even moderately complex apps. You're presented with several options:

1. Write controller code in views
2. Write controller code in models
3. Write controller code in a router
4. Write your own controller infrastructure

If you care about separation of concerns, none of these options are
really acceptable.

### Data and servers

Backbone packs a huge punch in a small package. It comes with
`Backbone.sync`, which lets you fully customize how you want to interact
with the server.

Following the CRUD pattern, Backbone lets you specify the response
format of an Read, but unfortunately doesn't allow you to fully
customize how you would like to serialize Create and Update and Delete
payloads for calling your server-side API. For my last project, I ended
up just completely redefining Backbone.sync, which is very powerful, but
I needed to write a lot of boilerplate to make it work reasonably.

The problem with Backbone's approach is that it doesn't separate two
parts of data stores: internal collection management and the interface
with the backend API.

Ember data, on the other hand, has the concept API adapters, which let
you specify the interface the server in response to the inner workings
of the adapter. And, additionally it has a DataStore model. I haven't
experimented with this in Ember yet, but SproutCore's version of this
worked quite well.

### Performance considerations

When I worked on iWork.com, we definitely had some issues with
SproutCore performance for large amounts of data. The problem was that
we couldn't really optimize our code because we were locked into the way
SproutCore does things, so our way forward was to patch SproutCore
itself to address some of the performance issues, or break out of the
framework and implement the performance intensive part manually.

Jeremy voices this concern here:

And I agree with him. It's very legitimate concern for large apps, and
Yehuda didn't answer adequately in my opinion.

I'm a bit concerned about this point and would love to hear a less
handwavy answer from Yehuda.

## Final thoughts (Backbone)

My conclusion from writing an app with Backbone, and attending a Bocoup
training workshop, is that Backbone by itself is not sufficient for
building complex web apps. You will invariably go one of two directions:

1. Engineer a lot of stuff on top of it, or
2. Use existing Backbone plugins of various maturity and hope they work
   well together.

Based on my experience with jQuery, and the mess of ensuing plugins, The
latter seems overly optimistic. So basically, be prepared to write a lot
of extra [boilerplate][] code. But if you're a JavaScript developer, you
can handle that!

In practice, it's very difficult to remain productive if you're writing
both an app and a framework at the same time. Unfortunately this was my
tendency when using Backbone. I hate reinventing the wheel. Especially
if it's kind of lopsided.

That said, Backbone is fantastic for mid-to-low complexity applications
that want to maintain structured code.

## Final thoughts (Ember)

Ember, on the other hand, forces you into its way of doing things. This
is a framework with opinions that gives you less flexibility. However,
if you grit your teeth a little bit and buy in, you'll be exposed to a
well thought out set of libraries that work well together.

I really like the features Ember offers, and its philosophy of finding
common problems developers will face and solving them. One thing I
anticipate is that many of the non-core Ember modules are immature.
However, just having these modules that are designed to work together is
a boon for serious application developers.

I'm still concerned that Ember applications may be stuck if dealing with
particularly hairy custom view situations, or large amounts of data, but
I'll have a better sense of the limitations soon.
